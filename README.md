# ShowAllBackgrounds.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](https://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert.

It displays the background layers of inactive glyphs in Edit view, i.e., all glyphs except the one currently open for editing. It displays paths in a pinkish color, components in a pastel orange. It works best if you disable *View > Fill Preview*.
